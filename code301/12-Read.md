## EJS Partials
### What are partials and why would we use them?
Partials are kind of a function which make it easier to maintain and control larger websites. Which can be just not having to go changing a little piece of text in every page it appears. This can be like having the same nav and footer across all pages. To create this you are going to want to make a directory of views/partials/ and create a file called navbar.ejs. This will only contain the HTML for the nav bar at the top of the home and other pages. To make the footer you can just name that file footer.ejs and place it in the same directory as the navbar. They are pretty simple really. At least I think so lol. That is really cool that they can go across all pages and not have to rewrite the same code for all pages multiple times.
