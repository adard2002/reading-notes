## What is node.js used for?
This can be used to help with building your javascript files, static assets, running tests, or automatic code linting. 
Node.js lets us run javascript on a server. Everything that happens in node is a reaction to an event. It is constantly checking or listening to what the user is doing and when the user reacts in a way that is coded in node js it triggers the specific action to take place. This helps with user interactivity because who wants to just stare at a screen. Especially if you are playing a video game and you cant do anything. 

## Why is node.js good to use?
It is suited for building application that require some real-time or live interaction. Like chats like Discord, Steam, and zoom possibly. These are some things that are live and node js could be used to make these work live.
