# Interfaces

## Inferfaces
- Contain definitions for a group of related classes or functionalities which either a non-abstract class or struct must have. 

## Back to Basics
### What is an interface?
The basic thing about Interfaces is that they are used to separate how we use something from how it's being implemented. Used to solve very specific problems which allow us to interact with objects based on WHAT they do not HOW they do it.

## Other 
I was having a hard time understanding what they are saying about Interface.

[Interfaces](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Sharp_Programming/Interfaces#:~:text=An%20INTERFACE%20in%20C%23%20is,of%20method%20and%20property%20declarations.)
- Are type definitions similar to classes
- Collection of method and property declarations
- Enables classes to have multiple behaviors being defined

- Can't have private members
- All members of the Interface are public and abstract by default
### Why would we use Interface?
- Total abstraction
- Multiple inheritance and abstraction

- Used along with classes to define a contract; a contract is like garanteeing what a class will provide for an application.
- Declares properties and methods.
