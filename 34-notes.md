# Xamarin

## What is Xamarin?
Xamarin is an open-source platform for creating modern application for iOS, Android and Windows with .NET. It's an abstraction layer which keeps track of communication of shared code with underlying platform code. Xamarin runs in a managed environment that provides memory allocation and garbage collection. It allows for developers to share 90% of their apps across platforms. This is mainly for developers who share code and test and business logic across platforms, and for those who write cross-platform application in C# with VS.

### Xamarin.Essentials
This is a library which provides cross-platform APIs. Examples of functionality this provides:
- Device info
- File system
- Accelerometer
- Phone dialer
- Text-to-speech
- Screen lock

### Xamarin.Forms
This is an open-source UI framework which allows developers to build Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, and Windows apps from single shared codebase. This allows for developers to create user interfaces using XAML in C#. Some examples of provided features:
- XAML user-interface language
- Databinding
- Gestures
- Effects
- Styling
