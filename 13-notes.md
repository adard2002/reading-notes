# Dependency Injection

## Dependency Injection
Dependencys are objects that another object depends on.

### What is SOLID?
Solid is an acronym which stands for:
S - Single-responsibility Principle<br>
O - Open-closed Principle<br>
L - Liskov Substitution Principle<br>
I - Interface Segregation Principle<br>
D - Dependency Inversion Principle<br>

### Definition of each letter in the acronym:
- Single-responsibility Principle: Tells you a class should have only 1 reason to change; should only have 1 job<br>
- Open-Closed Principle: Objects or entities should be open for extension but restricted for modification; class shuold be able to extend without modifying or changing the class itself<br>
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class<br>
- Interface Segregation Principle: Client shouldn't be forced to rely on methods they don't use<br>
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Entities should be based on abstractions, not on concretions. High-level modules shouldn't depend on the lower-level modules but should depend on abstractions
