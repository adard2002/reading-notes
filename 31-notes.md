## What are Razor Pages
Razor Pages application is technically MVC application and have the same features as MVC views. Razor Pages is a simplified web application programming model. The Razor Pages files are found under the Pages directory.

## Why Razor Pages?
1. Easier to get to web development for beginners because Razor Pages are not as in depth as MVC. There are people who come from other scripting languages like ASP or PHP who prefer Razor Pages than MVC
2. Razor Pages fit better to smaller scenarios where building controllers and models as separate classes are overkill.

The Razor Pages can make coding page-focused scenarios easier than using controllers and views.
