## What is open source software?
It's a software with source code that anyone can make changes to, inspect, and enhance.
- Source Code: This is the part of software that most users won't see, it's a programmers who can make changes of how a piece of software(program or applications)works. Programmers who have access to a computers program's source code can improve that program by adding features or fixing any parts that might not work correctly.

## Difference between open source and other software?
Some software has source code that is restricted to only the person or team who have permission to make changes to the program. This is called proprietary or closed source software.
- Open source: The authors make the source code available to others who would like to view the code, or alter it or share it. Examples: LibreOffice and GNU Image Manipulation Program
- Closed source: Only the original authors of the software legally copy, inspect or alter the software. In order to use proprietary software the computer users must agree that they won't do anything with the software that the authors have not given permission, some examples of this are Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop.
