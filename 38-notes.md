# Xamarin: Device Features

The Xamarin.Essentials provide us with cross-platform APIs for mobile applications. Every mobile app requires access to native functionality which is a software program developed for use on a certain platform or device and has the ability to use device-specific hardware and software.

## Features that apps need
- Connectivity: Checks connectivity and detects changes
- Device Information: Used to find out more information about the user's device
- Geolocation: Retrieves the device's GPS location
- Secure Storage: Makes sure the data on the device is securely stored and safe
- Version Tracking: Tracks the user's app versions and build numbers
