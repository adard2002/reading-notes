# Unit Testing and Documentation


## Unit Testing Best Practices 
- What is unit testing?
"Unit tests isolate and exercise specific units of your code." - https://stackify.com/unit-testing-basics-best-practices/ 


## XUnit Documentation http://xunit.github.io/#documentation 
The site wouldn't work; said "Site not found"


## Art of Readme
- Readmes allow for someone to look and see what the site is, show parts of the working site, how to use it, and any other details you may want to address. A lot of the times the first thing people will go to is your README.
- If you don't have a readme you should definitely look into that since it's one of the first things people will want to look at and people will always find their way to your readme. You don't want it to be blank or extremely vague about your site. The better your readme the more successful you will become in the future and the more likely you may get a job possibly.
- If you don't have a readme it will force your viewers to go into your code to understand it.
